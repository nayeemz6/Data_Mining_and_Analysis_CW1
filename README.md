<h2>Coursework Specification</h2>
<h3>Coursework Aim:</h3>
<p>This team-based assignment involves analysing a real-world dataset and creating
meaningful insights to address certain business concerns and problems identified.
You’ll be working in pairs for this assignment</p>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>The objective of this individual assignment is to evaluate
your understanding of the basic theory, concepts, and
various methods and algorithms in data mining, and assess
your skills of applying appropriate Python packages, such
as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, etc., to
carry out a data mining project.
The dataset for this coursework is related to London Fire
Brigade (LFB) incidents reported from 2019 to 2022. Your
role in this project is two-fold: acting as a business client and
as a data analyst. As a business client, you are expected to
raise meaningful business concerns/problems in relation to
the data given. And as a data analyst, you are required to
follow a proper data mining methodology and apply various
techniques covered in lectures to analyse your data to
address the business concerns and problems having been
raised. </P>
<h3>Tasks</h3>
<h4>We undertook the following tasks:</h4>
<h5>1. Problem Identification</h5>
<p>
1.1.Read the data description file (metadata) to learn the
basic characteristics of the dataset including the
certain business context associated with the data,
the total number of attributes (dimensions,
variables), the data type of each attribute, the value
range/mode, skewness, and kurtosis of each
attribute, the total number of instances, and simple
data exploration with essential plotting, etc.<br>

1.2.Identify a set of meaningful business problems of
interest with regard to the data for analysis.<br>

1.3.Identify what data mining tasks need to be performed
in order to address the business problems raised.</p>

<h5>2. Data Preparation</h5>

<p>2.1.Determine which variables to be used in which
analysis. Also refer to 1.2. and 1.3. Task 1.
<br>

2.2.Get your data for analysis. Choose appropriate
methods for data pre-processing, including detecting
and dealing with incorrect data types, irrelevant
variables, missing values, outliers, imbalanced
classes, and duplicates, changing data type, and
conducting proper dimensionality reduction, feature
extraction, data transformation, data partition, and
normalisation, etc. where appropriate. Also refer to
1.1. Task 1.<p/>

<h5>3. Model Construction</h5>
<p>3.1.With the pre-processed dataset undertake the data
mining tasks you have identified in 1.2. You are
required to apply two different algorithms for both
predictive and descriptive modellings. For
descriptive modelling, you may choose to use the kmeans clustering and various EDA (Exploratory Data
Analysis) methods, e. g., histograms, bar charts, and
Person’s correlation coefficient, etc. For predictive
modelling, for example, you may use decision trees
and artificial neural networks, or decision trees and
k-nearest-neighbour, etc.<br>

3.2.In order to build the most appropriate and accurate
models and identify meaningful hidden patterns,
different settings for the relevant model parameters
should be considered for each of the selected
algorithms and methods.</p>

<h5>4. Model Interpretation and Evaluation</h5>
4.1.Interpret the descriptive models created, such as
clusters created using k-means algorithms,
correlation among variables, and various relevant
plots created.<br>

4.2.Compare the performances of different predictive
models in terms of accuracy, error rate,
generalisation capability (over-fitting), simplicity and
cost, etc., where appropriate.<br>

4.3.Discuss the meaningfulness and usefulness of the
models built and the patterns revealed, and how the
models and the patterns can be used to address
the original business concerns. This includes both
descriptive and predictive models.</p>

<h5>5. A summary of the main findings of the project and
suggestions to LFB based on your analysis.</h5>
